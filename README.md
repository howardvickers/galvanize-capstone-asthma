## Predicting Asthma Rates in Colorado by County

### Introduction
#### Overview & Purpose				
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm to predict asthma rates as influenced by pollutants and socio-economic factors by county in Colorado.

A particular interest is the relative potential impact of oil/gas extraction facilities vis-Ã -vis other air-borne pollutants and household (cigarette) smoke.    

The oil and gas industry emits methane, benzene and other pollutants and the industry is now the largest source of methane in the U.S. Many of these toxic air pollutants have been linked to increased health issues (including cancers and respiratory problems).  Furthermore, as oil and gas development increasingly occurs in residential areas, residential proximity may also be associated with increased risk.  Other pollutants have well-known impacts on asthma.

ZNA Health have generously offered support with identifying data sources and with environmental/medical questions.

#### Data
